A simple project, implementing basic HTML

In this simple project, I learned and implemented basic HTML to create the structure of a recipe page.
I used following HTML syntax and concepts that I have learned so far
- HTML boilerplate
- headings
- paragraphs
- unordered and ordered lists
- links (anchors and images)
